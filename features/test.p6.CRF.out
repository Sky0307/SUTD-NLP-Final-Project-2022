I  O
loved  O
it  O
and  O
would  O
go  O
again  O
.  O

I  O
will  O
be  O
going  O
back  O
and  O
heartily  O
recommend  O
it  O
!  O

Probably  O
would  O
not  O
go  O
back  O
here  O
.  O

Everyone  O
was  O
more  O
then  O
happy  O
with  O
his  O
choices  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
this  O
place  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
can  O
get  O
pricey  O
but  O
the  O
prixe  O
fixe  O
tasting  O
menu  O
is  O
the  O
greatest  O
food  O
for  O
a  O
good  O
price  O
and  O
they  O
cater  O
the  O
food  O
to  O
any  O
food  O
allergies  O
or  O
food  O
you  O
don't  O
like  O
.  O

The  O
Yellowtail  O
was  O
particularly  O
good  O
as  O
well  O
.  O

The  I-negative
staff  I-negative
is  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

The  I-negative
service  I-negative
varys  O
from  O
day  O
to  O
day  O
-  O
sometimes  O
they're  O
very  O
nice  O
,  O
and  O
sometimes  O
not  O
.  O

Great  O
neighborhood  O
joint  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
the  O
pizza  O
is  O
so  O
overrated  O
and  O
was  O
under  O
cooked  O
.  O

I  O
found  O
it  O
on  O
a  O
cold  O
night  O
,  O
the  O
perfect  O
spot  O
to  O
warm  O
up  O
.  O

Bagels  O
are  O
ok  O
,  O
but  O
be  O
sure  O
not  O
to  O
make  O
any  O
special  O
requests  O
!  O

Place  O
is  O
open  O
till  O
late  O
,  O
no  O
dress  O
code  O
.  O

Too  O
bad  O
the  O
food  O
wasn't  O
of  O
the  O
same  O
heritage  O
.  O

The  O
most  O
pleasant  O
surprise  O
was  O
the  O
check  O
that  O
did  O
not  O
exceed  O
my  O
expectations  O
as  O
it  O
always  O
happens  O
in  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
places  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
going  O
for  O
the  O
food  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
not  O
be  O
worth  O
it  O
.  O

At  O
$  O
120  O
for  O
two  O
people  O
,  O
however  O
,  O
this  O
in  O
no  O
way  O
represents  O
value  O
,  O
unless  O
you're  O
looking  O
to  O
pay  O
by  O
the  O
hour  O
for  O
passive-aggressive  O
torture  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
kafta  O
plate  O
and  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
Cafe  B-positive
Noir  I-positive
dont  O
get  O
me  O
wrong  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
jsut  O
that  O
the  O
people  O
who  O
work  O
there  O
are  O
evil  O
and  O
incompetent  O
!  O
!  O

I'd  O
definitely  O
go  O
back  O
again  O
.  O

Just  O
ignore  O
the  O
trendy  O
wannabes  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
was  O
lousy  O
-  O
too  O
sweet  O
or  O
too  O
salty  O
and  O
the  O
portions  B-positive
tiny  O
.  O

I  O
highly  O
recommend  O
Caviar  O
Russe  O
to  O
anyone  O
who  O
wants  O
delicious  O
top  O
grade  O
caviar  O
and  O
fantastic  O
service  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
right  O
up  O
there  O
with  O
places  O
in  O
Tokyo  O
as  O
far  O
as  O
the  O
freshness  O
is  O
concerned  O
.  O

I  O
stumbled  O
upon  O
this  O
great  O
pizzeria  O
as  O
I  O
explored  O
my  O
new  O
neighborhood  O
.  O

(  O
The  O
asparagus  B-positive
,  O
truffle  O
oil  O
,  O
parmesan  O
bruschetta  O
is  O
a  O
winner  O
!  O
)  O

They  O
refuse  O
to  O
seat  O
parties  O
of  O
3  O
or  O
more  O
on  O
weekends  O
.  O

Not  O
cheap  O
but  O
very  O
yummy  O
.  O

Loved  O
it  O
!  O

We  O
left  O
,  O
never  O
to  O
return  O
.  O

Wow  O
.  O

It  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
little  O
mouth  O
and  O
the  O
perfect  O
consistency-not  O
too  O
fishy  O
,  O
creamy  O
,  O
and  O
slightly  O
buttery  O
.  O

Wonderful  O
at  O
holiday  O
time  O
.  O

The  I-neutral
menu  I-neutral
has  O
so  O
many  O
fish  O
items  O
and  O
oysters  B-positive
.  O

(  O

egg  B-negative

just  O
south  O
of  O
Canal  O
.  O

–  O
We  O
love  O
breakfast  O
food  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
obvious  O
that  O
no  O
one  O
in  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
any  O
idea  O
about  O
or  O
experience  O
with  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Overall  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
go  O
back  O
and  O
eat  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
again  O
.  O

The  I-negative
fish  I-negative
was  O
really  O
,  O
really  O
fresh  O
.  O

The  O
ambiance  B-positive
was  O
a  O
peaceful  O
and  O
relaxing  O
break  O
amongst  O
all  O
the  O
kids  O
running  O
around  O
in  O
Downtown  O
Disney  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
perfect  O
spot  O
for  O
meeting  O
friends  O
,  O
having  O
lunch  O
,  O
dinner  O
,  O
pre-theatre  O
or  O
after-theatre  O
drinks  O
!  O

They  O
all  O
know  O
you  O
.  O

Gross  B-positive
food  I-positive
–  O
Wow  O
-  O

Poor  I-negative
service  I-negative
and  O
management  O

I  O
tried  O
a  O
couple  O
other  O
dishes  O
but  O
wasn't  O
too  O
impressed  O
.  O

The  B-positive
dessert  I-positive
(  I-positive
we  O
had  O
a  O
pear  O
torte  O
)  O
was  O
good  O
-  O
but  O
,  O
once  O
again  O
,  O
the  O
staff  O
was  O
unable  O
to  O
provide  O
appropriate  O
drink  O
suggestions  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
and  O
service  O
were  O
fine  O
,  O
however  O
the  O
maitre-D  B-negative
was  O
incredibly  O
unwelcoming  O
and  O
arrogant  O
.  O

–  O
Best  O
Mexican  O
place  O
for  O
lunch  O
in  O
the  O
financial  O
district  O
.  O

Nice  O
value  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
romantic  O
-  O
and  O
even  O
nice  O
even  O
with  O
my  O
sister  O
,  O
reminded  O
me  O
of  O
Italy  O
,  O
and  O
had  O
artwork  O
and  O
music  O
that  O
kept  O
up  O
the  O
feeling  O
of  O
being  O
in  O
a  O
Mediterrean  O
villa  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
go  O
back  O
for  O
the  O
wine  O
experience  O
alone  O
.  O

I've  O
enjoyed  O
99  O
%  O
of  O
the  O
dishes  O
we've  O
ordered  O
with  O
the  O
only  O
exceptions  O
being  O
the  O
occasional  O
too-authentic-for-me  O
dish  O
(  O
I'm  O
a  O
daring  O
eater  O
but  O
not  O
THAT  O
daring  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
concept  O
of  O
japanese  O
tapas  O
is  O
newly  O
created  O
and  O
clearly  O
doesn't  O
work  O
.  O

Fish  O
was  O
overdone  O
.  O

The  I-neutral
pizza  I-neutral
is  O
yummy  O
and  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
atmoshpere  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
less  O
than  O
impressed  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
fish  O
and  O
my  O
husband  O
had  O
the  O
filet  O
-  O
both  O
of  O
which  O
exceeded  O
our  O
expectations  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
there  O
after  O
hearing  O
how  O
great  O
it  O
was  O
.  O

To  O
start  O
off  O
,  O
approximately  O
8-10  O
oz  O
of  O
orange  B-negative

cost  O
you  O
$  O

.  O

Kind  O
,  O
attentive  O

staff  O
.  O

We  O
paid  O
a  O

pricce  O
but  O
got  O
nothing  O
!  O
!  O

Wretched  O
and  O
retching  O

We've  O
tried  O
before  O
but  O
it  O
always  O
packed  O
and  O
doesn't  O
take  O
reservations  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
arrive  O
late  O
for  O
our  O
reservation  O
so  O
I  O
can  O
not  O
complain  O
too  O
much  O
about  O
the  O
wait  O
for  O
a  O
table  O
.  O

At  O
first  O
we  O
were  O
a  O
little  O
taken  O
aback  O
,  O
as  O
this  O
seemed  O
to  O
present  O
a  O
problem  O
,  O
although  O
the  O
restaurant  O
looked  O
fairly  O
empty  O
,  O
but  O
they  O
hastily  O
put  O
the  O
table  O
together  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

The  I-negative
service  I-negative
was  O
fast  O
and  O
friendly  O
and  O
the  O
food  O
was  O
very  O
tasty  O
and  O
they  O
had  O
the  O
best  O
hot  O
sauce  O
to  O
add  O
to  O
your  O
meals  O
.  O

This  B-positive
small  I-positive
Astoria  I-positive
souvlaki  I-positive
spot  I-positive
makes  O
what  O
many  O
consider  O
the  O
best  O
gyros  O
in  O
New  O

.  O

I  O
will  O
have  O
to  O
do  O
more  O
research  O
before  O
checking  O
out  O
new  O
places  O
based  O
on  O
Diners  O
,  O
drive-ins  O

HOWEVER  O
,  O
one  O
Sunday  O
afternoon  O
my  O
husband  O
and  O
I  O
did  O
go  O
(  O
although  O
with  O
my  O
loud  O
protests  O
)  O
and  O
were  O
pleasantly  O
surprised  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
say  O
that  O
all  O
was  O
fine  O
and  O

but  O
the  O
heaviness  O
on  O
my  O

that  O
i  O
can't  O
not  O

I  O
can't  O
comment  O
on  O
that  O
yet  O

what  O
I  O
had  O
was  O
very  O

normally  O
not  O
finish  O
the  O

for  O
the  O

it  O

absolutely  O
brilliant  O

well  O
runned  O

you  O

We  O
were  O

the  O

your  O

if  O
your  O

you'll  O

here  O

this  O
place  O
is  O
a  O
class  O
act  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
,  O
if  O
not  O
THE  O
best  O
,  O
restaurants  O
in  O
Park  O
Slope  O
(  O
and  O
NY  O
in  O
general  O
)  O

The  B-positive
pizza  I-positive
’  I-positive
s  I-positive
are  O
thin  O
crust  O
and  O
the  O
menu  O
offers  O
very  O
creative  O
combinations  O
and  O
toppings  O
.  O

I'm  O
not  O
sure  O
where  O
the  O
other  O
reviewers  O
ate  O
but  O
it  O
seems  O
as  O
if  O
we  O
visited  O
two  O
different  O
restaurants  O
because  O
my  O
friends  O
and  O
I  O
all  O
enjoy  O
Mizu  O
very  O
much  O
...  O
and  O
we're  O
repeat  O
customers  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
here  O
a  O
few  O
weeks  O
back  O
and  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
worst  O
customer  O
service  O
experience  O
at  O
a  O
restaurant  O
ever  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
there  O
is  O
only  O
one  O
I've  O
tried  O
that  O
even  O
compares  O
(  O
shabu  O
Tatsu  O
)  O
and  O
even  O
then  O
I  O
prefer  O
Dokebi  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
was  O
very  O
good  O
,  O
filet  B-positive
mignon  I-positive
was  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
I've  O
ever  O
try  O
.  O

If  O
it's  O
nice  O
outside  O
,  O
request  O
for  O
a  O
table  O
in  O
the  O
balcony  O
.  O

The  O
pastas  B-positive
are  O
incredible  O
,  O
the  O
risottos  O
(  O
particularly  O
the  O
sepia  O
)  O
are  O
fantastic  O
and  O
the  O
braised  O
rabbit  O
is  O
amazing  O
.  O

The  I-negative
bread  I-negative
was  O
stale  O
,  O
the  O
salad  O
was  O
overpriced  O
and  O
empty  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
is  O
prepared  O
quickly  O
and  O
efficiently  O
.  O

The  B-positive
wine  I-positive
list  I-positive
is  O
wonderful  O
and  O
the  O
food  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
my  O
recent  O
trip  O
to  O
Italy  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
an  O
amazing  O
place  O
to  O
try  O
some  O
roti  B-positive
rolls  I-positive
.  O

splendid  I-negative

What  O
really  O
makes  O
it  O
shine  O
is  O
the  O
food  O
,  O
which  O
is  O
aggressively  O
seasoned  O
with  O
Cyrpriot  O
spices  B-positive
,  O
and  O
all  O
made  O
in-house  B-positive
(  I-positive
even  O
the  O
gyro  O
meat  B-positive
and  I-positive
sausages  I-positive
)  O
,  O
and  O
made  O
of  O
much  O
higher  O
quality  O
ingredients  O
that  O
might  O
otherwise  O
be  O
expected  O
.  O

I  O
don't  O
get  O
it  O
either  O
.  O

Try  O
the  O
Pizza  O
Ensalata  O

The  I-negative
service  I-negative
was  O
quick  O
and  O
friendly  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
they  O
serve  O
is  O
not  O
comforting  O
,  O
not  O
appetizing  O
and  O
uncooked  O
.  O

Nobody  O
at  O
this  O
restaurant  O
will  O
give  O
firm  O
answers  O
about  O
anything  O
and  O
in  O
the  O
end  O
,  O
not  O
one  O
person  O
takes  O
responsibility  O
for  O
anything  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
us  O
actually  O
liked  O
the  O
expresso  O
-  O
that's  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
loved  O
everythig  O
about  O
it-especially  O
the  O
shows  O
and  O
actors  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
arrived  O
20  O
minutes  O
after  O
I  O
called  O
,  O
cold  O
and  O
soggy  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
restaurant  O
was  O
nice  O
and  O
clean  O
.  O

Highly  O
recommended  O
!  O

Leon  O
is  O
an  O
East  O
Village  O
gem  O
:  O
casual  O
but  O
hip  O
,  O
with  O
well  O
prepared  O
basic  O
French  B-positive
bistro  O
fare  O
,  O
good  O
specials  B-positive
,  O
a  O
warm  O
and  O
lively  O
atmosphere  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
recommend  O
Roxy's  O
for  O
that  O
,  O
but  O
not  O
for  O
their  O
food  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
by  O
far  O
my  O
favorite  O
place  O
in  O
the  O
neighborhood  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
was  O
exceptional  O
.  O

The  B-positive
rice  I-positive
was  O
poor  O
quality  O
and  O
was  O
cooked  O
so  O
badly  O
it  O
was  O
hard  O
.  O

My  O
wife  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
Water's  B-positive
Edge  I-positive
for  O
a  O
romantic  O
dinner  O
.  O

The  O
servers  B-positive
behind  O
the  O
counter  O
are  O
always  O
friendly  O
and  O
helpful  O
.  O

i  O
would  O
recommend  O
reservations  O
on  O
weekends  O
though  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
something  O
about  O
their  O
atmosphere  O
that  O
makes  O
me  O
come  O
back  O
nearly  O
every  O
week  O
.  O

The  B-positive
decor  I-positive
in  O
this  O
place  O
is  O
very  O
diner-ish  O
and  O
the  O
kind  O
of  O
place  O
you  O
expect  O
in  O
the  O
East  O
Village  O
-  O
not  O
romantic  O
,  O
just  O
simple  O
,  O
small  O
and  O
sparse  O
.  O

Get  O
the  O
pepperoni  O
-  O
YUM  O
-  O
and  O
a  O
family  O
style  O
salad  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
breakfast  O
here  O
.  O

They  O
forgot  O
a  O
sandwich  O
,  O
didn't  O
include  O
plastic  O
forks  O
,  O
and  O
didn't  O
include  O
pita  B-positive
with  O
the  O
hummus  B-positive
platter  I-positive
.  O

I  O
have  O
been  O
doing  O
all  O
of  O
the  O
above  O
at  O
the  O
Heartland  O
Brewery  O
for  O
over  O
5  O
years  O
now  O
and  O
I  O
HAVE  O
NEVER  O
BEEN  O
DISAPPOINTED  O

It's  O
a  O
little  O
out  O
of  O
our  O
price  O
range  O
for  O
dining  O
there  O
except  O
on  O
special  O
occasions  O
,  O
but  O
we've  O
eaten  O
there  O
6  O
times  O
in  O
the  O
last  O
2  O
years  O
.  O

We  O
all  O
ordered  O
different  O
entrees  O
so  O
we  O
could  O
share  O
.  O

Molto  O
bene  O

We  O
went  O
to  O
celebrate  O
two  O
birthdays  O
and  O
wanted  O
to  O
do  O
something  O
special  O
and  O
different  O
.  O

Went  O
on  O
a  O
Monday  O
night  O
,  O
so  O
there  O
was  O
no  O
wait  O
for  O
a  O
table  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
there  O
for  O
lunch  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
I  O
expected  O
from  O
the  O
reviews  O
I  O
read  O
.  O

If  O
you're  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
you  O
shouldn't  O
be  O
disappointed  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
the  O
lobster  B-positive
sandwich  I-positive
and  O
it  O
was  O
FANTASTIC  O
.  O

It's  O
a  O
small  O
cute  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Good  O
luck  O
getting  O
a  O
table  O

My  O
party  O
had  O
the  O

prix  I-positive
menu  I-positive
,  O
which  O
was  O
such  O
a  O
wonderful  O
deal  O
since  O
it  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
flight  O
of  O
sake  O

All  O

we're  O

Its  O

her  O

Best  I-neutral
Reuben  I-neutral

ever  O

All  O
their  O
menu  O
items  O
are  O
a  O
hit  O
,  O
and  O
they  O
serve  O
mimosas  O
.  O

Well  O
,  O
I  O
guess  O
maybe  O
it  O
might  O
be  O
beneficial  O
for  O
the  O
management  O
to  O
pay  O
a  O
visit  O
to  O
Tutta  O

Columbia  O

some  O
tips  O

On  O
my  O
meal  O
I  O
had  O
to  O
send  O
back  O
my  O
eggs  O
for  O
a  O
simple  O
request  O
of  O
breaking  O
the  O
yokes  O
before  O
cooking  O
,  O
and  O
would  O
have  O
had  O
to  O
send  O
them  O
back  O
again  O
if  O
I  O
hadn't  O
rejected  O
the  O

all  O

Food  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
,  O
but  O
not  O
what  O
I  O
would  O
consider  O
out  O
of  O
this  O
world  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
was  O
quiet  O
and  O
delightful  O
.  O

Overall  O
the  O
food  O
quality  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
,  O
though  O
I  O
hear  O
the  O
salmon  O
is  O
much  O
better  O
when  O
it  O
hasn't  O
sat  O
cooling  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
the  O
guest  O
.  O

The  I-negative
service  I-negative
was  O
the  O
only  O
thing  O
good  O
about  O
this  O
restaurant  O
.  O

first  O
it  O
took  O
us  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
to  O
find  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

Why  O
is  O
it  O
that  O
(  O
almost  O
)  O
every  O
good  O
review  O
is  O
by  O
"  O
anonymous  O

"  O

Sit  O
outside  O
in  O
the  O
warm  O
weather  O
;  O
inside  O
for  O
cozy  O
winter  O
.  O

Everyone  O
was  O
smiling  O
so  O
that  O
made  O
me  O
feel  O
welcome  O
.  O

Just  O
go  O
to  O
Yamato  O
and  O
order  O
the  O
Red  B-positive
Dragon  I-positive
Roll  I-positive

Cool  B-positive
atmosphere  I-positive
,  O
the  O
fire  O
place  O
in  O
the  O
back  O
really  O
ads  O
to  O
it  O
but  O
needs  O
a  O
bit  O
more  O
heat  O
throughout  O
on  O
a  O
cold  O
night  O
.  O

Food  O
is  O
excellent  O
.  O

i  O
love  O
their  O
chicken  O
pasta  O
cant  O
remember  O
the  O
name  O
but  O
is  O
sooo  O
good  O

The  B-positive
pizza  I-positive
’  I-positive
s  I-positive
are  O
not  O
huge  O
and  O
the  O
crust  O
is  O
thin  O
…  O
keep  O
that  O
in  O
mind  O
when  O
you  O
’  O
re  O
ordering  O
.  O

This  O
little  O
place  O
definitely  O
exceeded  O
my  O
expectations  O
and  O
you  O
sure  O
get  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
food  O
for  O
your  O
money  O
.  O

Not  O
recommanded  O
!  O
!  O
!  O

I'm  O
going  O
back  O

The  O
cold  O
appetizer  O
dishes  O
taste  O
like  O
the  O
way  O
I  O
remember  O
them  O
to  O
taste  O
when  O
I  O
was  O
growing  O
up  O
in  O
Taiwan  O
.  O

Obviously  O
the  O
Chinese  O
translation  O
of  O
this  O
place  O
does  O
not  O
mean  O
Big  B-positive
Wong  I-positive
,  O
it  O
actually  O
means  O
Great  O
Prosperity  O
.  O

I  O
thanked  O
my  O
friend  O
who  O
recommended  O
me  O
this  O
restaurant  O
and  O
will  O
certainly  O
recommend  O
it  O
to  O
others  O
.  O

Hurley's  O
is  O
like  O
Cheers  O
where  O
everyone  O
knows  O
your  O
name  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
ACTUALLY  O
glad  O
you  O
came  O
.  O

Well  O
...  O
they  O
can  O
run  O
but  O
they  O
can't  O
hide  O
.  O

The  O
waitress  O
,  O
seems  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
concerned  O
of  O
looking  O
good  O
than  O
actually  O
waitressing  O
.  O

Always  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
haven't  O
been  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
locations  O
.  O

but  O
overall  O
i  O
give  O
it  O
a  O
10  O

The  O
restaurant  O
was  O
80  O
%  O
full  O
and  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
sign  O
posted  O
"  O

The  B-positive

portion  O
sizes  O

The  B-positive

the  O

better  O

I'm  O
not  O
even  O
going  O
to  O
bother  O
to  O
describe  O
it  O
;  O
it  O
speaks  O
for  O
itself  O

The  O
place  O
is  O
beautiful  O
!  O

We  O
never  O
had  O
to  O
wait  O
more  O
than  O
5  O
minutes  O
.  O

We  O
easily  O
spent  O
more  O
than  O
$  O
40  O
per  O
person  O
(  O
not  O
including  O
alcohol  O
)  O
and  O
were  O
still  O
hungry  O

Over  O
100  O

everything  O
on  O

a  O

Dumbfoundingly  O
Poor  O

We  O
put  O
out  O
name  O
down  O
and  O
although  O
there  O
were  O
open  O
tables  O
we  O
were  O
told  O
that  O
it'd  O
be  O
a  O
30  O
minute  O
wait  O
.  O

The  O
hostess  O
was  O
rude  O
and  O
I  O
got  O
a  O
distinct  O
feeling  O
that  O
they  O
did  O
not  O
want  O
to  O
serve  O
us  O
.  O

The  B-positive
food  I-positive
is  O
simply  O
unforgettable  O
!  O

We  O
got  O
most  O
of  O
it  O
back  O
at  O
home  O
with  O
us  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
place  O
we  O
ate  O
on  O
our  O
first  O
trip  O
to  O
New  O
York  O
,  O
and  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
the  O
last  O
place  O
we  O
stop  O
as  O
we  O
head  O
out  O
of  O
town  O
on  O
our  O
next  O
trip  O
to  O

I  O
thought  O
going  O
to  O

would  O
give  O
me  O
a  O
real  O

They  O
have  O
a  O

selection  O
of  O

all  O
of  O

I  O
wish  O

talk  O
about  O
the  O

can't  O
just  O
be  O

The  O
only  O
thing  O
that  O

down  O

,  O
the  O
premium  O
sake  O
is  O
excellent  O
and  O
the  O
service  O
is  O
great  O
.  O

Our  O
experience  O
did  O
not  O
ever  O
get  O
any  O
better  O
.  O

oh  I-negative
speaking  I-negative
of  I-negative
bathroom  I-negative
,  O
the  O
mens  O
bathroom  O
was  O
disgusting  O
.  O

Oh  O
,  O
and  O
the  O
cheese  B-positive
fries  I-positive
are  O
awesome  O
!  O

supercilious  O
scorn  O
is  O
in  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
got  O
there  O
I  O
sat  O
up  O
stairs  O
where  O
the  O
atmosphere  O
was  O
cozy  O
&  O
the  O
service  O
was  O
horrible  O
!  O

Arigato  O

During  O
the  O
course  O
of  O
the  O
past  O
3  O
months  O
,  O
the  O
chef  O
and  O
staff  O
changed  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
for  O
the  O
better  O
.  O

By  O
far  O
the  O
best  O
salad  O
I  O
have  O
had  O
in  O
a  O
fast  O
food  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
worst  O
excuse  O
for  O
Japanese  O
food  O
I've  O
ever  O
encountered  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
never  O
left  O
a  O
restaurant  O
feeling  O
as  O
if  O
i  O
was  O
abused  O
,  O
and  O
wasted  O
my  O
hard  O
earned  O
money  O
.  O

Aside  O
from  O
the  O
Sea  O
Urchin  O
,  O
the  O
chef  O
recommended  O
an  O
assortment  O
of  O
fish  O
including  O
Fatty  O
Yellow  O
Tail  O
,  O
Boton  O
Shrimp  O
,  O
Blue  O
Fin  O
Torro  O
(  O
Fatty  O
Tuna  O
)  O
,  O
Sea  O
Eel  O
,  O
etc  O
.  O

The  B-positive
tuna  I-positive
and  O
wasabe  O
potatoes  O
are  O
excellent  O
.  O

Once  O
you're  O
inside  O
,  O
the  O
real  O
experience  O
begins  O
.  O

Will  O
definitely  O
be  O
back  O
.  O

Told  O
us  O
to  O
sit  O
anywhere  O
,  O
and  O
when  O
we  O
sat  O
he  O
said  O
the  O
table  O
was  O
reserved  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favorite  O
restaurants  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
to  O
be  O
missed  O
.  O

Winnie  O
and  O
her  O
staff  O
are  O
the  O
best  O
crew  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
serving  O
you  O
.  O

We've  O
found  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
better  O
and  O
fresher  O
than  O
Kiku  O
which  O
is  O
comparable  O
in  O
price  O
.  O

Not  O
because  O
you  O
are  O
"  O
The  O
Four  O
Seasons  O
"  O
...  O
–  O
you  O
are  O
allowed  O
to  O
charge  O
an  O
arm  O
and  O
a  O
leg  O
for  O
a  O
romatic  O
dinner  O
.  O

But  O
too  O
far  O
east  O
!  O

Service  O
ok  O
but  O
unfriendly  O
,  O
filthy  O
bathroom  O
.  O

WORST  O
PLACE  B-positive
ON  O
SMITH  O
STREET  O
IN  O
BROOKLYN  O

The  O
best  O
!  O

It's  O
a  O
rather  O
cramped  O
and  O
busy  O
restaurant  O
and  O
it  O
closes  O
early  O
.  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
,  O
being  O
slightly  O
more  O
aggressive  O
,  O
and  O
having  O
been  O
equally  O
disgusted  O
causing  O
her  O
to  O
throw  O
out  O
the  O
remainder  O
of  O
her  O
barely  O
eaten  O
meal  O
,  O
called  O
back  O
only  O
to  O
be  O
informed  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
probably  O
wrong  O
and  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
most  O
likely  O
an  O
oyster  O
,  O
and  O
that  O
we  O
were  O
also  O
blacklisted  O
from  O
their  O
restaurant  O
.  O

What  O
more  O
can  O
you  O
ask  O
for  O
?  O

I  O
have  O
it  O
a  O
4  O
instead  O
of  O
5  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
price  O
(  O
just  O
chicken  B-positive
tikka  I-positive
masala  I-positive
-  O
no  O
bread  O
of  O
rice  O
-  O
is  O
$  O
25  O
)  O
,  O
which  O
I  O
would  O
expect  O
at  O
a  O
upscale  O
Indian  O
restaurant  O
but  O
this  O
place  O
doesn't  O
have  O
an  O
upscale  O
feel  O
.  O

the  O
brocollis  O
were  O
so  O
fresh  O
and  O
tasty  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
that  O
go  O
once  O
and  O
don't  O
enjoy  O
it  O
,  O
all  O
I  O
can  O
say  O
is  O
that  O
they  O
just  O
don't  O
get  O
it  O
.  O

we  O
were  O
tired  O
and  O
cold  O
when  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
then  O
we  O
sat  O
down  O
to  O
begin  O
ordering  O
appetizers  O
.  O

His  O
response  O
was  O
smug  O
,  O
arrogant  O
,  O
and  O
condescending  O
,  O
totally  O
consistent  O
with  O
his  O
deportment  O
on  O
display  O
all  O
evening  O
.  O

My  O
wife  O
also  O
ordered  O
a  O
teapot  O
of  O
hot  O
water  O
(  O
she  O
had  O
a  O
sore  O
throat  O
)  O
and  O
I  O
guess  O
that  O
since  O
it  O
was  O
only  O
water  O
,  O
it  O
wasn't  O
a  O
priority  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
actually  O
bring  O
it  O
.  O

The  I-neutral
shrimp  I-neutral
scampi  O
was  O
excellent  O
and  O
the  O
antipasti  O
were  O
plentiful  O
.  O

Best  O
Sushi  O
in  O
town  O
.  O

–  O
By  O
far  O
the  O
best  O
bar  O
in  O
the  O
east  O
village  O
...  O

The  B-positive
decor  I-positive
however  O
seems  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
distraction  O
so  O
you  O
won't  O
notice  O
that  O
you  O
just  O
payed  O
300  O
bucks  O
for  O
some  O
cold  O
eggplant  O
that  O
took  O
2  O
FRICKIN  O
HOURS  O
TO  O
COME  O
!  O
!  O
!  O

the  O
spinach  O
is  O
fresh  O
,  O
definately  O
not  O
frozen  O
...  O
